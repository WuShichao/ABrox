# ABrox

`ABrox` is a python package for Approximate Bayesian Computation accompanied by a user-friendly graphical interface.

## Installation

`ABrox` can be installed via pip. Simply type `pip install abrox` into your terminal. It might take
a few seconds since there are several dependencies that you might have to install as well. 

## ABrox using the GUI

After `ABrox` has been installed, you can start the user interface by typing `abrox-gui`.
We provide several templates in order to get more familiar with the GUI. 

## ABrox using Python

If you are more comfortable with plain Python, you can run your project once from the GUI and
continue working with the Python-file that has been generated in the output folder.
